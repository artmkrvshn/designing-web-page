## Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements:

- Users should be able to view a list of available books in the library. 
- Users should be able to search for books by title or author. 
- Users should be able to filter books by category or genre. 
- Users should be able to see details of each book, such as title, author, year of publication, and availability status.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
